# GBA_BUTANO_TEMPLATE
To compile the game to an official .gba file - cd into the /game folder and run `make`. Once complete you should have a `game.gba` file. Drag that file into any GBA emulator to play!

To change the ROMs' filename, update the /game folder name.

You should be able to write this ROM file to an official GBA game cartridge to play on a real Gameboy.

HAPPY CODING!

⚠️ Have not tested on macOS or linux. Can only confirm this works for Windows.
